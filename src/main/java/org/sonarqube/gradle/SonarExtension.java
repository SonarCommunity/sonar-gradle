/**
 * An extension for configuring the <a href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+with+Gradle">Sonar</a> analysis.
 * <p>
 * The extension is added to all projects that have the {@code "sonar-gradle"} plugin applied, and all of their subprojects.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * sonar {
 *   skipProject = false // this is the default
 *   properties {
 *     property "sonar.host.url", "http://my.sonar.server" // adding a single property
 *     properties mapOfProperties // adding multiple properties at once
 *     properties["sonar.sources"] += sourceSets.other.java.srcDirs // manipulating an existing property }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <h3>Sonar Properties</h3>
 * <p>
 * The Sonar configuration is provided by using the {@link #properties(org.gradle.api.Action)} method and specifying properties.
 * Certain properties are required, such as {@code "sonar.host.url"} which provides the address of the server.
 * For details on what properties are available, see <a href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analysis+Parameters">Analysis Parameters</a>
 * in the SonarQube documentation.
 * <p>
 * The {@code "sonar-gradle"} plugin adds default values for several plugins depending on the nature of the project.
 * Please see the <a href="http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analyzing+with+Gradle">SonarScanner for Gradle documentation</a>
 * for details on which properties are set and their values.
 * <p>
 * Please see the {@link SonarProperties} class for more information on the mechanics of setting Sonar properties,
 * including laziness and property types.

   * This is the project that has the {@code sonar-gradle} plugin applied.

   * The action is passed an instance of {@code SonarQubeProperties}.
   * Evaluation of the action is deferred until {@code sonarqube.properties} is requested.
   * Hence it is safe to reference other Gradle model properties from inside the action.
   * <p>
   * SonarQube properties can also be set via system properties (and therefore from the command line).
   * This is mainly useful for global SonarQube properties like database credentials.
   * Every system property starting with {@code "sonar."} is automatically set on the "root" project of the SonarQube run 
   * (i.e. the project that has the {@code sonar-gradle} plugin applied).
   * System properties take precedence over properties declared in build scripts.
